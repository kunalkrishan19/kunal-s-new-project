Welcome to our repository! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up and remotely connecting your Git project with GitHub. Follow these steps to seamlessly manage your project, commit changes, and push updates to your GitHub repository.

Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Begin by initializing a new Git repository in your project folder. Use the following command:git init

This creates a hidden .git folder in your project, indicating that it's now a Git repository.

Step 2: Add and Commit Changes

Add your project files to the staging area using:git add .

Commit the changes with a descriptive message:git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository

If you haven't created a repository on GitHub yet, do so now. If you have, you can skip this step.

Step 4: Add GitHub Remote

Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:git remote add origin https://github.com/kunalkrishan19/kunal-s-new-project.git

Step 5: Create and Switch Branch

Create a new branch for your work:git branch my_new_branch

git checkout my_new_branch

Step 6: Work on Your Code

Edit your project files, like example.py. Ensure to follow best practices and make meaningful changes to your codebase.Step 7: Add, Commit, and Push Changes

Add and commit your changes:git add example.py

git commit -m "Added Python file"

Push the changes to your GitHub repository:git push -u origin my_new_branch

If you've set up the branch previously, you can use:git push origin my_new_branch
